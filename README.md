# 📘 R to Python: A Practical Translation Guide

Welcome to the **R to Python** series — a hands-on guide to translating common data science tasks from R to Python. This project is designed to help R users learn Python by mapping familiar R workflows to equivalent Python code using modern tools like **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and more.

Each lesson is presented as a Jupyter Notebook, paired with real datasets and examples. The goal is to help you move from *"How do I do this R thing in Python?"* to confidently using Python for your everyday data science tasks.
